How JSON works

// if we have more than one objects then put them in square brackets. 
// In one square bracket we can put more number of objects.
// it is a collection of objects.
// And also collection can call as document which is inside {}.
// Now this is called JSON
var a = [
    {
        "name": "Avengers",
        "rating": 4.5,
        "type": "Action",
    },
    {
        "name": "Romeo Juliet",
        "rating": 4.9,
        "type": "Romantic",
    },
    {
        "name": "Joker",
        "rating": 4.8,
        "type": "Thriller",
    }       
]
